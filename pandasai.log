Little Women,"Keppeler, Jill",Picture Book,"4.15 out of 5 stars, based on 2,957 ratings",revised edition,"The Mothers meets An American Marriage in this dazzling debut novel about mothers and daughters, identity and family, and how the relationships that sustain you can also be the ones that consume you. The Butler family has had their share of trials, as sisters Althea, Viola, and Lillian can attest, but nothing prepared them for the literal trial that will upend their lives. Althea, the eldest sister and substitute matriarch, is a force to be reckoned with and her younger sisters have alternately appreciated and chafed at her strong will. They are as stunned as the rest of the small community when she and her husband Proctor are arrested, and in a heartbeat the family goes from one of the most respected in town to utter disgrace. The worst part is, not even her sisters are sure exactly what happened. As Althea awaits her fate, Lillian and Viola must come together in the house they grew up in to care for their sister's teenage daughters. What unfolds is a stunning portrait of the heart and core of an American family in a story that is as page-turning as it is important.",,"Single mothers — Fiction, Bloggers — Fiction, Female friendship — Fiction, Missing persons — Fiction, Deception — Fiction",https://kdl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S174C978253,S174C939099,Undetermined,"Fiction, Core",,,Historical Fiction Featuring Books or Libraries,,Fiction and Nonfiction for Genealogy Buffs,2024-03-18 00:00:00 UTC,https://kdl.bibliocommons.com//list/share/1709635859_kdl_teens/2370680579_stand_up

Not Equal,"Dimaline, Cherie, 1975-",Picture Book,"4.2 out of 5 stars, based on 4,216 ratings",February 2014,"""When an acclaimed author dies at the Regency Grand Hotel, it's up to a fastidious maid to uncover the truth, no matter how dirty.""--""Molly Gray is not like anyone else. With her flair for cleaning and proper etiquette, she has risen through the ranks of the glorious five-star Regency Grand Hotel to become the esteemed Head Maid. But just as her life reaches a pinnacle state of perfection, her world is turned upside down when J.D. Grimthorpe, the world-renowned mystery author, drops dead--very dead--on the hotel's tea room floor. When Detective Stark, Molly's old foe, investigates the author's unexpected demise, it becomes clear that this death was murder most foul. Suspects abound, and everyone wants to who killed J.D. Grimthorpe? Was it Lily, the new Maid-in-Training? Or was it Serena, the author's secretary? Could Mr. Preston, the hotel's beloved doorman, be hiding something? And is Molly really as innocent as she seems? As the case threatens the hotel's pristine reputation, Molly knows she alone holds the key to unlocking the killer's identity. But that key is buried deep in her past--because long ago, she knew J.D. Grimthorpe. Molly begins to comb her memory for clues, revisiting her childhood and the mysterious Grimthorpe mansion where she and her dearly departed Gran once worked side by side. With the entire hotel under investigation, Molly must solve the mystery post-haste. If there's one thing Molly knows for sure, it's that dirty secrets don't stay buried forever."" --","Fantasy fiction, Historical fiction, Mythological fiction",,https://kdl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S174C256235,,,,12.0,,Historical Fiction Audiobooks,Genre Guide,Winter Thrillers that will make you want to move south to escape....,2023-05-23 00:00:00 UTC,
Brave Girl,,eBook,"4.3 out of 5 stars, based on 564 ratings",revised text edition,"""April 18, 1906: A massive earthquake rocks San Francisco just before daybreak, igniting a devouring inferno. Lives are lost, lives are shattered, but some rise from the ashes forever changed. Sophie Whalen is a young Irish immigrant so desperate to get out of a New York tenement that she answers a mail-order bride ad and agrees to marry a man she knows nothing about. San Francisco widower Martin Hocking proves to be as aloof as he is mesmerizingly beautiful. While Sophie quickly develops deep affection for Kat, Martin's silent five-year-old daughter, his odd behavior leaves her with the uneasy feeling that something about her newfound situation isn't right. Then one early-spring evening, a stranger at the door sets in motion a transforming chain of events. Sophie discovers hidden ties to two other women. The first, pretty and pregnant, is standing on her doorstep. The second is hundreds of miles away in the American Southwest, grieving the loss of everything she once loved. The fates of these three women intertwine on the eve of the devastating earthquake, thrusting them onto a perilous journey that will test their resiliency and resolve and, ultimately, their belief that love can overcome fear. From the acclaimed author of The Last Year of the War and As Bright as Heaven comes a gripping novel about the bonds of friendship and mother love, and the power of female solidarity""--Provided by publisher.","Historical fiction, Jewish fiction","Baum, L Frank (Lyman Frank), 1856-1919 — Film adaptations — Juvenile literature, Wizard of Oz (Motion picture : 1939) — Juvenile literature, Fantasy fiction, American — Film adaptations — Juvenile literature",https://kdl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S174C547302,S174C750550,Teen,Nonfiction,,11.0,Ultimate Gift Guide for Teen Book Lovers,Top Picks,,2023-07-11 00:00:00 UTC,https://kdl.bibliocommons.com//list/share/1709636399_kdl_adults/2497983409_libros_nuevos_en_espa%C3%B1ol
